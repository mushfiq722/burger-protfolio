            A hamburger (also burger for short) is a food, typically considered a sandwich, consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled.
            <br> <br>
            The term "burger" can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom, where the term "patty" is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground beef. Since the term hamburger usually implies beef, for clarity "burger" may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger, bison burger, portobello burger, or veggie burger.

            Hamburgers are sold at fast-food restaurants, diners, and specialty and high-end restaurants. There are many international and regional variations of the hamburger.

            A steak burger is a marketing term for a hamburger claimed to be of superior quality,[38][39][40] except in Australia, where it is a sandwich containing a steak.

            Steak burgers are first mentioned in the 1920s. Like other hamburgers, they may be prepared with various accompaniments and toppings.

            Use of the term "steakburger" dates to the 1920s in the United States.[41] In the U.S. in 1934, A.H. "Gus" Belt, the founder of Steak 'n Shake, devised a higher-quality hamburger and offered it as a "steakburger" to customers at the company's first location in Normal, Illinois.[42] This burger used a combination of ground meat from the strip portion of T-bone steak and sirloin steak in its preparation.[42] Steak burgers are a primary menu item at Steak 'n Shake restaurants,[42] and the company's registered trademarks included "original steakburger" and "famous for steakburgers".[43] Steak 'n Shake's "Prime Steakburgers" are now made of choice grade brisket and chuck.[44]

            Hamburg steak has been known as "Frikadelle" in Germany since the 17th century.
            
            The "Hamburger Rundstück" was popular already in 1869, and is believed to be a precursor to the modern Hamburger.

            As versions of the meal have been served for over a century, its origin remains ambiguous.[4] The popular book The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse included a recipe in 1758 as "Hamburgh sausage", which suggested to serve it "roasted with toasted bread under it".. Hamburg steak is reported to have been served between two pieces of bread on the Hamburg America Line, which began operations in 1847. Each of these may mark the invention of the Hamburger, and explain the name.

            According to Connecticut Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, the hamburger, a ground meat patty between two slices of bread, was first created in America in 1900 by Louis Lassen, a Danish immigrant, owner of Louis' Lunch in New Haven.[11] Louis' Lunch, a small lunch wagon in New Haven, Connecticut, is said to have sold the first hamburger and steak sandwich in the U.S. in 1900.[12][13][14] New York Magazine states that "The dish actually had no name until some rowdy sailors from Hamburg named the meat on a bun after themselves years later", noting also that this claim is subject to dispute.[15] A customer ordered a quick hot meal and Louis was out of steaks. Taking ground beef trimmings, Louis made a patty and grilled it, putting it between two slices of toast.[8] Some critics like Josh Ozersky, a food editor for New York Magazine, claim that this sandwich was not a hamburger because the bread was toasted
